This is an exploratory repository for the creation of games with my kids.

It's written in Scala Lift but the majority of content is in Javascript, which you can find under

src/main/webapp/static/js/

In particular, the typing and spaceships game can be found at

src/main/webapp/static/js/flyover.js
